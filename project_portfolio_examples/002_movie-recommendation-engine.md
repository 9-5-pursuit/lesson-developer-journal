## Project 2: Movie Recommendation Engine

### Project name: Movie Recommendations

### Tools used:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL

### Project summary:

Movie Recommendations is a website that suggests movies to users based on their ratings of other movies. It uses collaborative filtering to predict which movies a user might enjoy.

### Project process:

1. Built a basic Express server that serves static files and uses a PostgreSQL database.
1. Created a React front-end that allows users to rate movies and see movie recommendations.
1. Built an Express API that allows users to retrieve and update movie ratings.
1. Implemented collaborative filtering using a library called surprise.js.
1. Deployed the website to Heroku.

### Project outcomes:

### Personal reflection:

This was a very challenging project, but it taught me a lot about data science and machine learning. It was also rewarding to see the website in action and to receive positive feedback from users. If I were to do it again, I would spend more time on the UI to make it more user-friendly.
