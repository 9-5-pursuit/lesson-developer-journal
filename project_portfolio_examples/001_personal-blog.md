## Project 1: Personal Blog

### Project name: My Personal Blog

### Tools used:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB

### Project summary:

My personal blog is a website where I can share my thoughts and experiences with others. It allows me to write blog posts, manage comments, and interact with readers.

### Project process:

1. Set up a development environment on my computer, including installing Node.js and MongoDB.
1. Built a basic Express server that serves static files.
1. Created an HTML and CSS template for my blog.
1. Created a MongoDB database to store blog posts and comments.
1. Built an Express API that allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts and comments.
1. Implemented authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).
1. Added a comment section to each blog post using AJAX to make asynchronous requests to the server.

### Project outcomes:

### Personal reflection:

This project was challenging, but also very rewarding. I learned a lot about full stack web development, especially how to integrate a database with a server using an API. If I were to do it again, I would spend more time on the front-end design to make it more visually appealing.
